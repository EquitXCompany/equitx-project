# EquitX Landscape Contract

This contract will have:

- a map of asset names ("xUSD") to contract addresses ("C123â€¦")
- a method to deploy new xAsset contract (so it will need to store the wasm of the xAsset contract, or a reference to it by name on the Loam Registry), which is only callable by admin.
- a method to list all CDPs for a given account, so it can iterate the "map of asset names" keys and make cross-contract calls to see if the given account has an entry in its CDPs map.
